# JungleDevs Challenge B1
Hi everyone, so in this test I decided to work as I would in a professional and team project, I decided to use NextJS because it is suitable for this type of service as a landing page. I used Typescript to keep everything in order and make life easier for anyone using InteliSense. I created a styling framework that uses css helper classes to speed up development and created unit tests on components and a CI to ensure everything is correct before uploading a commit.
